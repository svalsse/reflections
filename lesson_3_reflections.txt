When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
R/ I could want to create a file in github web site if I don't have my computer with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
R/ If I am working in some local changes, I could want finish my job before to get the lastest version from the remote repository.
